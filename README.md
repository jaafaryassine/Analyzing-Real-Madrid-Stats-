# Real Madrid Performance Analysis


In this project, I analyzed Real Madrid's performances from the start of the season until February 2023. For data scraping, I used Selenium to extract data from understat.com, and for data manipulation and visualization, I used Pandas and Matplotlib.

To analyze the performances of each player, I considered their goals, expected goals, and expected assists. I also introduced a new concept to determine the efficiency of a player (striker). The efficiency of each player is calculated as the ratio of goals to expected goals. A higher efficiency score indicates a more efficient player.

Upon visualizing the data, it became evident that Federico Valverde is the most efficient player in the Real Madrid squad. His shot power enables him to score goals even from less dangerous positions.

Additionally, I analyzed the team's performance by determining the situations from which goals were scored, such as open play, from a corner, set piece, direct free kick, or penalty.

Please note that the interpretation of efficiency is more complex than it seems. A player with a negative efficiency score does not necessarily mean that his performance is poor. It could be that the player puts himself in more dangerous positions than other attacking players. To interpret this concept accurately, we must compare his expected goals score with the average.
