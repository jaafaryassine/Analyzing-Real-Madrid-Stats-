# Analyzing-Real-Madrid-Stats-Using-Python

In this project, I analyzed Real Madrid performances (From start of the season until February Month 2023), using selenium for scraping data from understat.com 
and Pandas, matplotlib for manipulate and visualize data.

To be more specific, the perfomances of each player are based on Goals, Expected Goals And Expected Assists, also I introduce a new concept that tell us how the player is efficient. Indeed, the efficiency of each player is the difference of Goals and Expected Goals. So more the efficiency is higher, more the player is efficient.
In visualizing data, we notice that Federico Valverde is the more efficient player in Real Madrid Squad and that is explained by the shot power of this player. He can score a goal even his position is not dangerous.

In addition, I Analyze the team performance by inspecting from which situation the goal is been scored (ex : Open Play, From Corner, Set piece, Direct Freekick or Penalty)

P.S : The interpretation of the efficiency is more complexed than it look, because the player who has a negative efficient doesn't mean that the player performance is not good.
